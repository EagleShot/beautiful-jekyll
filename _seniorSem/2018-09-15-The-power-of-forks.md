We all love fork (cutlery), but I am talking about a programming fork especially version control forks. [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) defines beautifully. It enables a user to experiment with a code base while leaving the original codebase intact but this has special implications for FOSS projects.
It allows contributors with different visions to create several versions of the code base and nurture the project as they see fit. Thus, people who might otherwise have had left the project or have had to reinvent the wheel can now continue development, and the FOSS community wins as a result.

Then why do we not see thousands of forks for every project? Forks a project do not necessarily mean that contributors will follow the new fork leaving the original project behind. Conversations can often solve many differences. If all a contributor wants to do is develop a new feature or solve a bug but is worried about messing up the code base, the solution is to *branch*. Branching will give them a copy of the code base without making a separate copy that is will eventually diverge from the original code base. This article explains the difference and use-cases in detail: [Branching vs. Forking](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/branch-or-fork-your-repository-221450630.html).

Forking has resulted in several versions of Linux which are now general or specialized projects. Each of the different flavors serves users with different needs and varied level of expertise. However, forking is not always beneficial and should be done with caution. Forking divides the code base. If it is not actively maintained and some users use it without being aware that it is not the primary development branch, it can leave security loopholes. It can also lead to a reduction of contributors from the original code base and slow down development momentum. This helps keep the founders and the top contributors in line and helps maintain a positive environment. If the users do not feel welcomed, they can also create an environment that is more welcoming and conducive to both their and the project's development. Everyone deserves to be respected and appreciated no matter when they join a project or how he or she contributes.

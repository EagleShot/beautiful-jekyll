Hello again in the journey to becoming FOSS ninjas! Today, I want to write about Git. Specifically, how to get started with Git. This is not another Git tutorial. This is just a collection of my thoughts, things I wish I knew when I began to use git along with things my friends shared they wanted they know which came up during one of our discussions because let's be real, no one likes a Git showoff, but everyone wants to be one.

The easiest way to start with Git, try it out and make a portfolio to show that world what you have done while making contributions to the community as a while is GitHub. Students even get special discounts and privileges if they sign up using a *.edu* account.

*Commits, push, branch, rebase......* if you are still here, then you have the courage to survive through the initial learning curve. To make the ride smoother, make sure you give [link](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) a try. This is a javascript based site that has excellent git tutorials. YouTube also has a massive collection of git tutorials.

When you get a hold of the initial sequence, start using it in the regular workflow. Some good practices are:
- Treat each repository as if you might have to show it to a professor/employer.
- Branch early, branch often
- Merge/rebase or delete completed branches
- Do no git stash, git pull. If something is broken, try to fix it
- If you break something, use this [How to undo almost anything with git](https://blog.github.com/2015-06-08-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git/)
- Make sure that each commit is deployable or completion of a subtask. Commits should not be used to save work in the literal sense.

So try to make a git repository, play around with it and if you are stuck, send me an email with subject **git help**. I am no git expert but it my experience and a bit of googling, I will try to help as many people as I can.

Free and Open Source Software(FOSS) allows a programmer to become much more than just a programmer writing code. It allows them the opportunity to let their code make an impact. They can create solutions to societal problems and create innovative solutions.

Several organizations are using code to make an impact in the society. While the most common way for programmers to contribute is making software that provides functionality, a new trend has been to teach others to code. There are websites like freeCodeCamp which enable individuals to learn to code, but this requires a person to have the fundamental knowledge and equipment.

An organization that is trying to bridge the technological gap is Code for Humanity (CFH). CFH allows individuals from all backgrounds to learn how to code. They have various programs and help organize local chapters that get together to help each other become technologically literate. Some people come to learn to host websites while others come to learn primary computers. There are others who learn to code and develop software.

The old proverb can explain the benefit of these programs:
`Give a man fish; you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish; you feed him for a lifetime.` Learning to code increases an individual's employability. Programs like this can make a significant impact on others.

Machine learning is a growing field with a lot of exciting applications. Most of their popular frameworks (Caffe, Tensorflow, Torch) are FOSS. Contributors feel that their efforts culminate to social good. It also helps in producing great code as everyone can see the code. FOSS is programmers' way of giving back to society. Given the widespread use of technology, this is a great way to have a significant impact on society.

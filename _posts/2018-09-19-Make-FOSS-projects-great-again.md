title: What should I look for when I explore a FOSS project?
categories: Senior_Seminar

My friends and I were searching for FOSS projects to contribute to. During our search, one of my friends said "Tell me a *good*  project to start with". It is then that we started to wonder what makes a FOSS project good. During our search, we came up with that makes a FOSS project for us. I wanted to share to anyone else who is trying to define the same questions.

- Mission statement: Does the project have a clearly defined mission statement? After reading it, try to explain it to a fellow programmer, if you can explain it, you understand it.
- New member communication: How is the communication with the new members? How are people who aren't asking the most innovative answers treated? Is the time of a new member who is no necessarily contributing to the most complicated bugs being valued?
- Project installation: How well docummented is the project installation? (Do not underestimate the importance of this step. Look for both standard and developer installations depending on the stage the project is at)
- Bug database: How well is the bug database maintained? How active are the developers in responding to the bugs? Is support being provided to the existing users or are the developers only concentrated in making *cool* things?
- Documentation quality: What's the quality of the documentation provided? Documentation can be a time consuming process which indicates how much care is put into tasks which might not necessarily be *cool* but makes it easier for the community to engage with the project.
  - How to get started threads: Is there clear documentation available for new developers to get started with the project?
  - Does the project list ways for people to contribute to the project if they are not developers?

When looking for these parameters, please keep the age of the project in mind. Several of these might be missing for a new project. If a mature project is missing several of these points, you might want to reconside your options. There are a lot of FOSS communities that are looking for great developers and your time might be more valued in a different community. If the project is new and you like the community, a great way to start would be to help add any of these points which it is missing.

Fake news has become rampant lately and has had a significant impact especially during the 2016 US election ([Science](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6425/374)).
Fake news is spread for various reasons including political, financial or social.

Fake news often presents an alternate side to a story that interests a group of the society distorting facts. These articles have click-bait titles which help
the content creators earn money from internet advertisement and from individuals or groups that would gain from the spread of misinformation. The latest challenge in
this battle has been machine learning. Advances in Machine learning has made creating of fake news much more convincing. It is now possible to create fake videos
of people saving whatever they want or to overlap faces of people over others with uncanny accuracy. These techniques have such good output that it is impossible for
an unsuspecting person to know that it was machine generated. While some people are trying to use it as satire or parody, people often believe it to be true ([Slate](https://slate.com/technology/2019/01/fake-washington-post-not-fake-news-yes-men-parody.html)).

Social media has slowly become the place most people go to get their share of the news. These platforms have optimized algorithms to keep people engaged because a person's optimized time
in the platform means more money for them. This creates a unique problem as clickbait articles are specifically designed to interest a specific group of people, and from them, these articles often
rank very high. This creates an echo chamber where people get their views validated. Fake news has created rampant misinformation and thus has turned into a social problem but censoring them has its problems. It is very had to draw the line between opinion and fake news at times. Most kinds of censorship have ended up being problematic in the past. While platforms have a responsibility to help stop the spread of fake news, I think the burden is a shared one. Users should understand how information flows on the internet. New sources build trust over time, and thus their credibility is what makes the news trustworthy. Machine learning is just a tool which can be used in many different ways. Censoring research because it might potentially be used for something nefarious or preventing people from posting material because it might be fake news will have negative repercussions down the road.

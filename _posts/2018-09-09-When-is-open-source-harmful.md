Producing OSS reading states "It's free as in freedom â€” think free speech, not free beer." Open source software is driving some of the most significant changes in artificial intelligence. TensorFlow(Google), pyTorch (Facebook) and OpenAI have produced code that is considered cutting edge and shared it for free. There is no denying that open source projects have a tremendous impact on today's world but pushing to make all code open source would not be optimal. Closed source protects against individuals who have competing incentives. 

An example of this scenario would be Google's PageRank algorithm. Google uses this to rank pages on web searches. Appearing on the top has real economic incentives, and companies spend millions on Search Engine Optimizations [An estimate](https://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/page-one-whats-google-rank-worth.html). Google tries to optimize its algorithms to make sure that the useful content is higher compared to pages that are made to abuse Google AdWord. If the code were open source, it would be much easier to reverse engineer the algorithm and push results higher.

The code should be open source when there are no competing objectives. Systems like the Linux kernel, OpenSSL, the Mozilla foundation products do not have significant competing parties. All the contributors want the software to be the best versions possible, and bugs are discovered very rapidly. On the other hand, critical infrastructure falls on the other category. the country or company which the infrastructure belongs to benefits from the infrastructure being up which competitors would like to gain every advantage they can on those systems. Being a closed sourced system, countermeasures can be placed or intrusions detected. If the software was open source, an installation could be set up and hacks developed and used against these systems causing total chaos. Open source adds excellent value to the society but making every piece of code open source would not be a good idea.

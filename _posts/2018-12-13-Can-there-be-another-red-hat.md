title: Can there be another Red Hat?
categories: Senior_Seminar

Red Hat has a very innovative open source system. The company produces three different operating systems which target different audiences. Their consumer version is Fedora. This is a very popular flavor of Linux for people who want an alternative to Ubuntu or Debian. The community contributes to Fedora. When a feature or request in Fedora becomes popular and survives the test of time, it is ported to RedHat Linux which is a server Linux. The unique feature of the company is that it then releases the code base and all the features of RedHat Linux as CentOS. Thus the community is benefiting from their contribution to the project.

Red Hat distinguishes its business through their subscription model. They provide support for the OS, provide packaged stable versions of OS and long-term updates. They also freeze the code base to provide standard OS versions. Thus the company successfully created a business based on open source.

The question that many people ask is: Can there be another Red Hat? There are several arguments on both sides. People who do not think there can be another Red Hat argue that Red Hat already fulfills all the needs of the server Linux market. Let us look at the question in a broader sense. Canonical has provided similar services to consumers on the desktop/laptop market. There provide LTS and packaged distributions that are extremely easy to install. Major companies are providing corporate clients with support on their open source products(Custom Androids/TensorFlow APIs).

tT will definitely be harder to start a new company that could reach Red Hat's popularity but given the boom in new areas of tech and the niche markets that are growing up, this seems like a viable strategy to me and something that could be profitable if done correctly.
